# ArwENS

ArwENS is a one-stop shop for registering ENS domain/subdomains, storing text or web pages on Arweave, 
and then linking your newly minted ENS domain to your Arweave content.

# Important Note
This Dapp only supports Ropsten ENS domains.  It's a submission for the [Grow Ethereum hackathon contest](https://gitcoin.co/issue/ArweaveTeam/Bounties/11/3273). If we win, we'll spend some real ETH and deploy on Mainnet. :)

## Features

1. Use either Metamask or Portis
2. Register ENS domains and subdomains
3. Post text and html files to the permaweb
4. Add the Arweave transaction ID associated with your permaweb file to your ENS domain
5. Supports ENS domain to Arweave file resolution (see gifs)
